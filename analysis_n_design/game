“Aliens have invaded a space ship and our hero has to go through a maze 
of rooms defeating
them so he can escape into an escape pod to the planet below. 
The game will be more like a Zork
or Adventure type game with text outputs and funny ways to die. 
The game will involve an engine
that runs a map full of rooms or scenes. Each room will print 
its own description when the player
enters it and then tell the engine what room to run next out of the map.”

The scenes are as follows:
1. Death: This is when the player dies and should be something funny.
2. Central Corridor: This is the starting point and has a Gothon already 
    standing there, which
    the player has to defeat with a joke before continuing.
3. Laser Weapon Armory: This is where the hero gets a neutron bomb to 
    blow up the ship before
    getting to the escape pod. It has a keypad he has to guess the number for.
4. The Bridge: Another battle scene with a Gothon where the hero places 
    the bomb.
5. Escape Pod: Where the hero escapes but only after guessing 
    the right escape pod.

Things to do:

1. Extract Nouns from this.
2. Extract verbs from the description.
3. Create a Class Hierarchy and Object Map for the Concepts

        Engine, Death, Player, Central Corridor, 
        Bridge, Laser Weapon Armory, Scene
